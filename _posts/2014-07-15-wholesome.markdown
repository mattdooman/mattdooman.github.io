description: I ran the wholesome memes twitter account. When I started, it had 300,000 followers which I have now raised to 3 million followers. I created and curated memes, liked comments and answered direct messages.  In addition, I made TikToks for the channel which culminated in 100,000 views each and did live videos on periscope.
